# Internship Overview: Afame Technologies

During this internship at Afame Technologies, I had the opportunity to work on three engaging projects, Calculator, Dynamic Portfolio and a Landing page. These projects involved web technologies such as HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

Through these projects, I gained hands-on experience in front-end web development and JavaScript programming. I learned how to structure and style web pages, handle user input and interactions, and create columns, divide sections, arrange items and add headers & footers. Additionally, I improved my problem-solving skills and also implemented responsive designs to these web projects.

Overall, this internship provided me with valuable learning opportunities and practical experience in web development, preparing me for future challenges in the field.
